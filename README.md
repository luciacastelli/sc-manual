This —ongoing— project is a training and educational initiative where I recreate the study “Single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics unravel the role of monocytes in neuroblastoma bone marrow metastasis” (Fetahu et al., 2023). My goal is to reproduce the analyses step by step, while explaining the biological concepts, R code, and reasoning in a way that is approachable for students and researchers alike.

By revisiting this study, I aim to:

1. Practice and document single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics workflows.
2. Explore how neuroblastoma tumor cells interact with the bone marrow microenvironment.
3. Share insights and resources as both a personal learning notebook and a teaching guide for others starting in this field.

At its core, this project reflects my approach to learning through doing and teaching by sharing. The goal is to turn complex cancer biology and computational pipelines into something accessible, yet thorough, for everyone.
